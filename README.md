# Data Visualization: 2023 US Women's Gymnastics Championships

## Motivation
After learning gymnastics growing up, I have always been interested in watching the sport at the professional level. Though Women's gymnastics has fairly high viewership in Olympic years, this dwindles in the off-years, leading to very limited avaiable data analysis. I began this analysis of the 2023 US Championships with two main goals:
1. to visuzlize the rankings of gymnasts on each event and the magnitude of their score differences
2. to determine which gymnasts have the potential to be on a highest-scoring 5 member team

The first goal is more straightforward. Women's gymnastics has four events: vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. In addition to the comparison of these event scores, there is also an All-Around ranking which compares the sum of each gymnasts's four events. </br>
The second goal requires additional context. While this competition was not directly used to select athletes for the World Championships a few weeks later, it did provide a first look at all routines for the 2023 year and a baseline for score analysis. Using these scores, I calculated team scores for every possible combination of 5 athletes for comparison. The intention was not necessarily to predict the World's team, because other factors that cannot be quantified also go into consideration; rather, it was meant to provide insight into which athletes were "in the mix" for selection based on this competition and promote discussion among the viewership community.

## Features

## Conclusions

## Future Applications
I tried to make this code as generalized as possible, such that its visualization methods and algorithms can easily applied to other competions.
